      <h2>The Swing</h2>
      <h4>Jean-Honor√© Fragonard</h4>
    </div>

    <h1>1767</h1>

      The painting depicts an elegant young woman on a swing. A smiling young
      man, hiding in the bushes on the left, watches her from a vantage point
      that allows him to see up into her billowing dress, where his arm is
      pointed with hat in hand. A smiling older man, who is nearly hidden in the
      shadows on the right, propels the swing with a pair of ropes. The older
      man appears to be unaware of the young man. As the young lady swings high,
      she throws her left leg up, allowing her dainty shoe to fly through the
      air.
