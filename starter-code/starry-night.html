  <h1>1889</h1>

 <p>
  Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's ground-floor 
  studio,it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. 
  The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east,a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including 
  The Starry Night."Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother, Theo, 
  around 23 May 1889,"I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the 
  morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."
