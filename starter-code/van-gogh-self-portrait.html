<h1> 1889</h1>
 <p>
  This self-portrait was one of about 32 produced over a 10-year period, and these 
  were an important part of his work as a painter; he painted himself because he 
  often lacked the money to pay for models. He took the painting with him to 
  Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he showed it to Dr. Paul Gachet, who thought 
  it was "absolutely fanatical". Art historians are divided as to whether this 
  painting or Self-portrait without beard is Van Gogh's final self-portrait. The 
  art historians Ingo F. Walther and Jan Hulsker consider this to be the last.
