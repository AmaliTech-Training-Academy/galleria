    <h1>1633</h1>

    <p>
      The painting, in vertical format, shows a close-up view of Christ's
      disciples struggling frantically against the heavy storm to regain control
      of their fishing boat. A huge wave beats the bow and rips the sail. One of
      the disciples is seen vomiting over the side. Another one, looking
      directly out at the viewer, is a self-portrait of the artist. Only Christ,
      depicted on the right, remains calm.
