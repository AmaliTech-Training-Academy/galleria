      The Night Café (French: Le Café de nuit) is an oil painting created by
      Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh in September 1888 in Arles. Its title is
      inscribed lower right beneath the signature. The painting is owned by Yale
      University and is currently held at the Yale University Art Gallery in New
      Haven, Connecticut. The interior depicted is the Café de la Gare, 30 Place
      Lamartine, run by Joseph-Michel Ginoux and his wife Marie, who in November
      1888 posed for Van Gogh's and Gauguin's Arlésienne; a bit later, Joseph
      Ginoux evidently posed for both artists, too.
