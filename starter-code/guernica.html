    <h1>1937</h1>

      The scene occurs within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands
      over a grieving woman holding a dead child in her arms. In the center of
      the room a horse falls in agony with a large gaping hole in its side, as
      if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. The horse appears
      to be wearing chain mail armor, decorated with vertical tally marks
      arranged in rows. A dead and dismembered soldier lies under the horse. The
      hand of his severed right arm grasps a shattered sword, from which a
      flower grows.
