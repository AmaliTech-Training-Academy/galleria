      <h2>The Boy in <br />the Red Vest</h2>
      <h4>Paul Cézanne</h4>
    </div>

    <h1>1889</h1>
    <p>
      Cézanne painted four oil portraits of this Italian boy in the red vest,
      all in different poses, which allowed him to study the relationship
      between the figure and space. The most famous of the four, and the one
      commonly referred to by this title, is the one which depicts the boy in a
      melancholic seated pose with his elbow on a table and his head cradled in
      his hand. It is currently held in Zürich, Switzerland. The other three
      portraits, of different poses, are in museums in the US
